  In this paper, we investigate methods to identify and understand
  mathematical relations expressed in text. We introduce the equation
  parsing task, which involves generating an equation from a sentence,
  as well as identifying what the variables represent. Our method
  leverages a new structure -- an equation parse, which allows for an
  efficient search over the space of all equations. We develop a
  structured prediction formulation, which leverages equation parse
  based inference techniques, and jointly grounds variables and
  generates equations. Experimental evaluation suggests that
  predicting relations with equation parses performs considerably
  better than baselines which use template matching techniques.

  To achieve these results we made several assumptions. The key one is
  that we only deal with expressions that are within a sentence. This
  should be lifted in future work. We also made a few assumptions on
  the way quantities are presented in the sentence (e.g., modifiers
  act in the same way on all variables, etc.) We believe that these
  assumption do not restrict our work but we intend to better quantify
  it in future.
