  Identifying mathematical relations expressed in text is a central
  challenge to solving algebra word problems, directed towards high
  school students. The task necessitates the detection of entities
  which should be represented as variables in the relation, as well as
  generating a mathematical equation involving the variables. This
  paper focuses on detecting mathematical relations described within a
  single sentence. We introduce a structured prediction formulation to
  jointly predict grounding of variables as well as the relation among
  them. Our hierarchical clustering based inference algorithm
  effectively leverages a knowledge base of mathematical concepts,
  naturally handles composition of mathematical expressions, and
  directly generates the necessary equation expressed in the text,
  without any dependence on predefined templates.
