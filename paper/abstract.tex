  Identifying mathematical relations expressed in text is essential to
  understanding a broad range of natural language text from election
  reports, to financial news, to sport commentaries to mathematical
  word problems.  The task necessitates necessitates identifying
  relevant entities in the text as well as mapping the text to a
  corresponding mathematical equation involving these variables.  This
  paper focuses on identifying and understanding mathematical
  relations described within a single sentence. We introduce an
  equation parse for sentences, which naturally handles composition
  and nesting of mathematical expressions, and directly generates the
  necessary equation expressed in the text. Our structured prediction
  formulation jointly grounds variables and generates an equation
  parse for a sentence. We demonstrate that extracting relations via
  equation parses improves accuracy over template based approaches.
