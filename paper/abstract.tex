  Identifying mathematical relations expressed in text is essential to
  understand the language used in mathemetical word problems,
  financial news and sports commentaries. The task necessitates
  detecting entities which should be represented as variables in
  the relation, as well as generating a mathematical equation
  involving the variables. This paper focuses on detecting
  mathematical relations described within a single sentence. We
  introduce an equation parse for sentences, which naturally handles
  composition of mathematical expressions, and directly generates the
  necessary equation expressed in the text. Our structured prediction
  formulation effectively leverages a knowledge base of mathematical
  concepts, and jointly grounds variables and generates an equation
  parse for a sentence. We demonstrate that extracting relations via
  equation parses improves accuracy over template based approaches.
