  In this section, we describe our dataset, and evaluate our system's
  performance on grounding variables and generating equations from
  text. We also compare our results against a template based baseline.

  \noindent \textbf{Dataset} We created a new dataset consisting of
  $400$ sentences extracted from algebra word problems and financial
  news headlines. For algebra word problems, we used a recently
  released MIT dataset \cite{KushmanZeBa14}, and two high school
  mathematics textbooks, Elementary Algebra (College of
  Redwoods) \cite{Redwoods} and Beginning and Intermediate Algebra
  (Tyler Wallace)\cite{Wallace}. Financial news headlines were The
  Latest News feed of MarketWatch \cite{MarketWatch}, over the month
  of February, 2014, was used a source of financial news
  headlines. Some statistics of the dataset are provided in
  Table \ref{tab:stats}

  Sentences were chosen such that each sentence has information
  describing exactly one mathematical relation. We also ensured that
  all quantities needed in the equation should be mentioned in the
  sentence.  Each sentence was annotated with the final equation. For
  each variable in the equation, we annotated spans of text which best
  describes what the variable represents.
